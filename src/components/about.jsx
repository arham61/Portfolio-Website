                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am an under-graduate from Comsats University Islamabad (Wah campus) pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I kick started my professional career as a MERN Stack developer working for a Pakistan based company — CapregSoft.
                    The tech industry is ever-evolving and I love being able to grow with it, while continually solidifying the fundamentals. I opensource my code from a place of empathy - for future developers, teammates, users, and with accessibility in mind. I also love joining communities, helping and mentoring new developers, and supporting organizations to promote diversity in tech. I’m sharing my programming journey on Linkedln, helping people who are just getting into the space of programming.
                </p>
